      <description>Class imbalance in binary classification refers to a situation where one class (minority class) has significantly fewer instances compared to the other class (majority class). For instance, in a customer attrition prediction task, the minority class could be customers who churned or left, while the majority class is customers who stayed with the company.
Class imbalance can pose a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly for binary classification tasks because most machine learning algorithms assume that the class distribution is balanced.</description>
